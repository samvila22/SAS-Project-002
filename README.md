# SAS-Project-002
Final project

This project contains 3 algorithms. The first of which takes a .csv datset and converts this dataset to a .sas7bdat file, one that is able to be opened in our files and observed unlike the .csv version. The second algorithm takes an input dataset(in this case the one converted to .sas7bdat in the prior) and merges this dataset with an existing gapminder dataset. This algorithm takes account for reshaping and transposing issues and overcomes these issues by making both datasets the same paraemters before merging is done. The third algorithm plots this merged dataset similar to the midterm project I also have listed in the directory. This accounts for single year or range of years and sends the resulting graph(s) to our file as a .png file.
